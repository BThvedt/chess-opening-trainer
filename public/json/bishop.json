    "In this version black doesn't play into the Urusov Gambit, and White launches into a version of the Max Lange attack.",
    "After 1 e4 e5 2 Bc4 begins the bishop's opening. It controlls d5, an important square, takes advantage of a central diagonal, attacks the vurnable f7 and white is close to castling.",
    "2...Nf6 is a very common respons and makes the Urusaov gambit possible, even if black doesn't go for it in this case. If black chooses to move the other knight 2 ... Nc6 would lead to the Vienna hybrid lines. Here there is a \"solid\" option for white with d3, leading to a more traditinoal Bishop's opening. But 3 d4 enters the shaper, riskier Urusov gambit. However, black doesn't go for it, leaving another option, the Max Lange attack. Black takes the central pawn ..",
    ".. And white goes for the gambit moving their knight out, but black chooses to defend with another knight insted. Now white has two options: the scotch gambit or the max lange attack. The scotch gambit is practically it's own line, and the Max Lange attack as well comes from an italian-esque opening with many sub lines itself. Here is one line of the Max Lange attack.",
    "White castles, and black moves out their bishop. If black takes e4 with a knight, that's a scotch gambit type of line. The bishop move however transposes into the Max Lange Attack.",
    "White begins the attack with e5. This attack is a good option for players who like tactical lines. Black chooses to respond with d5, practically the only move that allows them to create a solid position. There's no real good moves for the knight under threat. Kd7 is weird, and if black goes Kg4 white can respond with Bf4, followed by h3 kicking the knight and holding the center. Kg8, a suspicious move becuase white can go Kg5 pressuring f7, and following up with Re1. Then white can move the queen out to h5 or f3, putting more pressure, break the center with c3, possibly centralizing pieces with another knight move to e4. Black should not move their knight back, not only on opening principles, but it just lets white create an extremely strong position.",
    "White naturally captures the knight, black captures the bishop. Black can also take the pawn, which is a good line to learn if you want to have Max Lange as a main weapon.",
    "White throws a check with e1 and puts the rook on a very active square, always nice to do. Black moves the king but even though it looks kinda silly, it can be a dangerous move if black has time and can plan a good attack activating their pieces through the g-file.",
    "White goes bd2, activating their knight with a tempo attack on a pawn, something that's always a good idea to do if available. The plan is to continue by centrazlizing and cover important squares with Ne4. Black resonds with Qd5, in an attempt to hold the center. This however, isn't the best move because it allows white to go ahead with their plans.",
    "White moves Ke4, starting to conquer the dark squares, with the idea to contineue with Bg5, followed by taking the black pawn on g7 and then checking the king with Bf6 after the king captures. White would have several threats and black will have very bad issues holding everything. Black, with sparse options to continue, responds with Bf5, trying to develop and putting pieces in active spots, but it doesn't really do much!",
    "White takes g7, forcing the king to come out.",
    "White sacs the bishop! Black has to take, as moving back would result in a checkmate with Kf6",
    "White checks with the queen, black retreats. There is no anchor for black, as white had Qg5 and pretty much any other move is mate",
    "White moves Qg5, black must move their king to f8 (or hang their queen). With a followup to Qh6+, and then Kf3, black either gets checkmated or their queen and king forked anyway, not a bad compenscation for the bishop sacrifice! Of course black dien't have to move their queen out earlier, and could have chosen different moves at times, as there are many lines to the Max Lange."

    "In this version of the Bishops opening, Black opts to respond with Nc leading to the hybrid vienna opening",
    "After 1 e4 e5 2 Bc4 begins the bishop's opening. It controlls d5, an important square, takes advantage of a central diagonal, attacks the vurnable f7 and white is close to castling. Black chooses Kc3 as their response, which leads to the Vienna game.",
    "Many players here go d3, but Kc3 is a good option, because it develops and allows potential variations of the vienna, or even some transpositions into some kings gambit lines. Black must now carefully choose their plan. In this line, black chooses Bc5, a common move, with a possible Qf6 followup. But it's not the greatest move, because g87 becomes vurnable. Players that rely on the Gucco Piano might opt for this. But this is not the Gucci Piano.",
    "White takes advantage of the weak g7 with Qg4, an agressive move that might resemble a good variation of the Patzers opening. Black must be very careful! But they continue with their plan of Qf6, and now White has an advantage that is only gonna increase.",
    "White sends their knight to d5, further increasing danger for black, threatning both the queen and a fork. Black continues their attack with the scholar's mate-y looking Qf2, but it won't work out so good for them.",
    "Here white is fine with moving their king. They can continue by threatning the queen with Nh3 and then follow it up with Rf1 threatening to take f7, with options to take a pawn on Nc7 as well. If Black moves their queen to d4, white can completely trap it with d3 (defending the bishop on c4 and then with c3.

Without many options, black moves to h5, offering a queen trade, but white doesn't take it. If the Queen goes to d4 white traps with pawn to d3, forcing black to move the bishop to let the queen out, and white will put undefendable pressure on f1 with Rfa followed by Qf3 or Qh5",
    "White simply moves their queen to g5. Black has gotta do something. They go Qd4, but white's move do d3 puts the queen in the aforementioned trap, and if they don't move their bishop, white can go c3 and essentially win the game with a queen capture.",
    "White goes c3, and Black needs to create an escape route and goes Be7. White steps back to g3, and has a dominant position, with a plan of Rf1, Ng5, and c3. Black's king is vulrnerable and potentally exposed to harsh attacks!"
