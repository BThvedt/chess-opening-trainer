    "The scotch gambit starts out with the king's pawn opening, the most popular opening and response",
    "Kf3 is a common follow-up by white and black can respond with Kf6 or K c6, both can lead to the Scotch gambit. Here black chooses Kc6, a common move at this stage",
    "White now moves their bishop out, and Black follows up with another knight. Now it's time for a Scotch gambit if white chooses. There are a couple early deviations to this line such as Be7 and h6 ",
    "d4 begins the Scotch gambit. The most common response is exd4 which black chooses here.",
    "White responds with e5, and d5 is the most common follow up to that, although there are a lot of main deviations.",
    "White moves the bishop into a pin, and black moves the knight into the center, a principled move. Black can also respond with Nd7 which is a differnt line. Already here black can make some mistakes. One would be checking with the dark squared bishop, white defends with c3, then black takes with their d pawn, white retakes with their b pawn, and now black's bishop and knight are under pawn attack, or black can move their black knight here to g4, white responds with h3, then black can try h6 (Kxe5 can result in a pretty bad pin I think), white takes the knight with their dark bishop, black retakes with their g-pawn, and then white grabs the d4 pawn with the queen, which is also better for white.",
    "White grabs the pawn in the center, and black moves the light squared bishop in order to do something about the pin. Black can also go c5 here, but that is a different line.",
    "White grabs the knight, black responds by taking with the pawn to keep their bishop. To evaluate the position, note white has pawn majorith on the kingside, black has the majority on the queenside albiet with doubled pawn, black has kept their bishop pair, c5 is potentially weak (can't be defended with a pawn), and both sides have some plans. For white, f4-f5 (and maybe f6) is interesting, occupying c5 with a knight or bishop as an outpost is interesting as it can't be defended with a pawn, a4-a5 is a thought although I'm not sure what it does, something about the bishop. Black's plans could include advancing the c and d pawns then attacking the king with Bc6 Qd5, or to break up the center with f6 or f5, or exploit the bishop pair by playing on the light squares as white doesn't have their white squared bishop.",

    "White questions black's position with their knight, Black chooses to take it..",
    "White recaptures with the queen, black pushes c5",
    "White moves their knight back to f3. It is critical to control the diagonal from b7 to g2, from an attack, for instance Bc6 and Qd5. Black controls the c5 square, one of the pivital squares in these lines. Black may try to take control of the light squares at the cost of their bishop on b6, and white must make sure the b6 bishop remains tied down or taken while putting together a kingside attack, a promising idea is making a break with f4-f5, ideally prepared by h2-h3 and g2-g4, but getting there carries a lot of value and if the ideal plans cannot be managed even sacrifing a pawn to get there is worth it. Black responds with d4. They may try Bf5, an attractive spot, and the line may look 15 ... f5, 16 c3 O-O 17 b4 cxb4 18 cxb4 e7 19 d4 and white ends up better",
    "White slides their bishop back to f2 and black castles. Paraphrasing some guy named Fishbein: 'This is ht emain position of the Modern Attack. Black's light squared bishop has no counterpart and is dangerous, but their other pieces aren't doing much. THe position is difficult for both sides and roughly balanced, but play cna get sharp very fast",
    "White goes bishop h4, although different lines are tried here, this one is considered 'punchier' in their opinion. Black responds with Qc8. By advancing their pawns and bringing in the knight and the bishop white can potentially put the castled black king in a lot of trouble very fast",
    "White goes a4 to close down the kingside, black goes a5.",
    "White goes h3, providing a route for the king to out of the way of the black bishop staring at g1 through some pawns, making Kh2 possible and preparing g4. White is developing a kingside attack. Example: 19 ...c6, 20 Kh2 Qf5, 21 Rae5 Bxa4, 22 Rf2 and the attacking chances are worth losing a pawn. Another eample is 19 ... c4, 20 Kh2 c5 21 Qe2 threatening Qxc4 and preparing Nd2-e4"
