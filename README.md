# A personal project

Basically, last year, I set out to learn chess. I created a little program to run in the browser, and figured the best way to start getting better was to learn openings. My plan was, every time I played a game, and I came to a move where I didn't know what to do, I'd use the stockfish engine to find a few followups, then copy and paste the moves into my program. This only took a couple minutes per line, and I also got some books, and every day I'd ad like 10 or so lines, sometimes more, sometimes less, but a few every day.

Then if I play a game, I'd just review the opening a few times after I'm done. In this way I'd get a good feel for good opening moves. I think it works, actually. I went from 600 to over 1000 in rapid over this time period.

Cut to a bit over a year later, and I literally have a couple thousand lines in this little project. I'm seriously thinking of making a more robust version where people can sign up and have accounts and use the engine to explore/store weird openings and make notes on them and things like that (the oxford chess dictionary has like 1200 for exmaple) and have a few other features. But that's for the future.

In the meantime, I'm looking for a job so I thought I'd make this public as a demo project until I find one. Since it has a bunch of openings that are from books as well, I'll just take it back down after I find one. Gotta buy it yourself! But in the meantime probablly not much harm if I just have it as a demo of a project for a little while.
