Ok so this is how it's gonna work
Options: Play as white or black. Flip board. Show alternate moves. Hints or no hints. 
Select an opening.  
Once opening is selected, choose a line. 
If moves are in a line, play the line. If no alternate moves option is selected, user must play the "official" line
If alternate moves are selected, they display when there's interesting spots. Or you can choose next move. You can choose if it's the opposite color move, of make one yourself if it's your color.
If a line changes to a different line or an alternate, the name of the line changes
Some kind of error is indicated if wrong move is made. 
If end of a line is reached, some kind of success is indicatied.

Feature request: 
line randomizer from a list of selected lines
save lists of selected lines 
stockfish scores for each move
notes associated with each move 
notes associated with each line

move strings: 
b1c3 "move piece on b1 to c3"
first is white second is black
e2e4:c7c5
moves are seperated by | 
e2e4:c7c5|b1c3
I don't think I have to worry about promotions
last move is signified by a '*'
so for example, the closed basic sicilian is 
e2e4:c7c5|b1c3*
